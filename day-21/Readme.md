# JPQL

Java Persistence Query Language

- provides a standard mechanism to interact with RDBMS
- the queries are independent of the specific DB vendor
- works with entity objects (entity centric)
- object oriented
- portable
- syntax is similar to that of SQL
  - instead of tables, use class names
  - instead of columns, use the properties (variables with getter/setter)
- supports native queries (sql)
- pagination/sorting
